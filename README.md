* Saveable as Entries or Taxonomy Terms.
* Ability to regularly run feed imports or run them on-demand through the Control Panel.
* A history log of recent runs.
* Can use Laravel's queuing system so you can run imports in the background.

## Documentation

### Installation

**Via the Control Panel:**

1. In the Control Panel, go to `Addon` on the left menu.
2. On the addons page, search for `YumYum` and click on the first result that comes up.
3. Click `Install`
4. After installation is complete, you should be able to view a `Feeds` page in the CP, from there you can get started!

**Via composer:**

1. Require YumYum `composer require doublethreedigital/yumyum`
2. Once complete, you should be able to view a `Feeds` page in the CP, from there you can get started!

### How it works

YumYum has a concept of feeds, each feed has it's own source (a JSON, RSS, XML feed) and has a destination, whether that be entries in a collection or terms in a taxonomy.

Whenever a feed is run, it goes through three steps:

1. It'll use a 'source parser' to get the items from the feed and return it in such a way everything else can understand.
2. Then, the feed items will pass through a 'transformer', this decides how to map the data from your feed item into your fields.
3. After the data has been transformed, it will finally be saved as an entry or taxonomy term.

### Viewing Run History

If you want check the last time YumYum ran your feed, you can have a look at its 'run history'.

To view the history log, click on the name of your feed in the `Feeds` page of the Control Panel. You should then be able to view the last 10 times the feed has been run. It'll tell you both the date/time of last run and how many items were saved as part of that run. This may be helpful if you need to troubleshoot your feed not working correctly.

### Running your feed

This is probably what you installed YumYum for, to actually import & save your data! You've got two options when it comes to running your feed. You can either run it whenever you want via the CP or you can run it automatically with CRON/Laravel's scheduler.

**On-demand via the CP:**

1. In your `Feeds` page in the Control Panel, find the feed you'd like to run.
2. Click on the button at the end of the feed row, and click on the 'Run' option.
3. Your feed will now be running, either on your request, or on the queue, depending on your site's configuration.

**Automatically with the Laravel Scheduler:**

We're only going to cover the process of actually adding YumYum's command to the Laravel scheduler, not how to setup the scheduler on your server. You can learn about that over on the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#running-the-scheduler).

1. Open your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file.
2. Add the below snippet to the `schedule` method of the `Kernel.php` file

```php
/**
 * Define the application's command schedule.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
 * @return void
 */
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // $schedule->command('inspire')
    //          ->hourly();

    $schedule->command('yumyum')
        ->hourly();
}
```

That snippet will run YumYum's importer every hour. You may wish to adjust the schedule on which it's run, for that you may view the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#schedule-frequency-options).
